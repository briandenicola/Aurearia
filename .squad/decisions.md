# Squad Decisions

## Active Decisions

### Decision: Sets Type Refinement + Goal Completion Formula

**Date:** 2026-07-26  
**Agent:** Cassius  
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

## Context
Set semantics were refined: legacy `defined` is removed, `open` is renamed to `standard`, and Goal completion no longer uses target matching.

## Decision
- Normalize legacy set type values in DB migration logic:
  - `defined` -> `goal`
  - `open` -> `standard`
  - legacy `dynamic` -> `tracker` with `creation_mode='dynamic'`
- Add `creation_mode` on `coin_sets` (`manual` default, `dynamic` allowed only for `tracker` sets).
- Update Goal completion to: `collection_items / (collection_items + wishlist_items)` using set memberships + `coins.is_wishlist`.
- Keep tag-to-set migration idempotent and additive so newly tagged coins join existing migrated sets.

## Validation
- `go test ./repository -run "TestSetRepository_"`
- `go test ./services -run "TestSetService_CreateSet"`
- `go test ./database -run "TestMigrateCoinSetTypes_NormalizesLegacyValues"`
- `go test ./handlers -run "TestSetHandler_ReorderCoins"`
- `go test ./testutil`

### Decision: Frontend set-type normalization during Standard/Goal migration

**Date:** 2026-07-26  
**Agent:** Aurelia  
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

## Context
Set APIs are moving from legacy `open`/`defined` to `standard`/`goal`, with Tracker and Dynamic Tracker creation mode added. During rollout, frontend may receive mixed legacy/new set type values.

## Decision
Frontend now writes only `standard`, `goal`, `smart`, and `tracker`, while treating `open` and `defined` as legacy read aliases through a shared `normalizeCoinSetType()` helper in `src/web/src/types/index.ts`.

Membership and workflow gates branch on normalized values:
- Tracker and Smart sets are non-manual membership in Set Detail and Coin Tags surfaces.
- Completion panel loads for normalized `goal` and `tracker`.
- Collection set filter includes normalized `standard` sets.

## Rationale
This keeps UI behavior stable during mixed-contract deployments, prevents accidental legacy writes, and centralizes compatibility logic to avoid drift between components.

---

### Decision: Tracker set creation mode contract alignment

**Date:** 2026-07-26  
**Agent:** Maximus  
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

## Context
`SetCreationWizard` emitted `trackerCreationMode`, but backend set creation reads `creationMode`. Tracker sets created through the dynamic flow therefore persisted with backend default `manual` mode.

## Decision
Align frontend payload contract to backend by emitting `creationMode` in `CreateCoinSetRequest` and wizard submit payload. Keep prompt behavior unchanged, and add a focused frontend regression test asserting dynamic tracker submission emits `creationMode: "dynamic"` and not `trackerCreationMode`.

## Validation
- `npm.cmd run test -- src/components/sets/__tests__/SetCreationWizard.test.ts`
- `npm.cmd run type-check`

## Alignment
- Principle III: explicit typed frontend/backend contract field match
- Principle IV: smallest complete fix with targeted regression coverage

---

### Decision: Coin Grading as AI Analysis Sub-Action

**Date:** 2026-07-02
**Agent:** Aurelia
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

## Context
Coin grading is an AI-assisted per-coin workflow that returns an estimate report without mutating the saved coin grade.

## Decision
The user-facing grading entry point lives inside `CoinAIAnalysis.vue` beside obverse/reverse analysis instead of chat or a new store. It uses the existing async AI job polling pattern, requires both obverse and reverse images before start, displays `gradingReport` in-place, and includes permanent limitation copy that the estimate is not professional certification and does not update `Coin.grade` automatically.

## Alignment
- Principle III: typed API contract and frontend type-check passed.
- Principle IV: reused existing AI job polling surface without a new store.
- Principle VI: token-based in-panel UI with no emoji and existing button hierarchy.

---

### Decision: Coin Grading ships as a dedicated coin-detail AI job

**Date:** 2026-07-01
**Agent:** Maximus
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED
**Issue:** #374

## Context

Coin grading exists in `src/agent/app/teams/coin_grading.py` and the supervisor router advertises a `grading` intent, but the streaming chat path does not carry images. Routing grading requests through chat currently lands on a passthrough/dead-end unless a caller injects a grading node.

## Decision

Implement Coin Grading as a dedicated authenticated coin-detail action backed by the existing AI job system, not as image-capable chat attachments for this slice.

Recommended surface:
- Add a `Grade Coin` action on the coin detail AI Analysis page, using existing stored obverse/reverse/detail images.
- Queue `AIJobTypeCoinGrading` through Go, pass owner-scoped coin context and image bytes to Python `/api/grade`, then store the report in the job result.
- Do not write the estimated grade into `Coin.Grade` automatically. Offer an explicit `Apply to Grade` follow-up only after the user reviews the confidence/limitations.
- Remove supervisor grading advertising/dead-end behavior unless/until chat supports image attachments.

## Rationale

This keeps the feature aligned with Constitution Principle I/II: Vue calls Go, Go owns auth/image access/job persistence, Python remains stateless and receives only bounded per-request context. Reusing AI jobs matches the existing analysis/value UX, avoids introducing image-capable chat contracts prematurely, and provides clear regression points for no-image, success, and model-failure paths.

## Validation expected

- Agent: request model and `/api/grade` route tests for no-image, success, and graph failure.
- Go: service/job tests for no images, successful grading result persistence, and agent failure status.
- Frontend: component tests for disabled/no-image state, queued/success polling, failure display, and confidence/limitations copy.
- Contract: regenerate OpenAPI and run route drift test for any new Go route.

---

### Decision: Coin Grading Revision

**Date:** 2026-07-02
**Agent:** Maximus
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

Coin grading remains exposed through the dedicated `/api/grade` agent endpoint and Go `POST /coins/:id/grade` AI job workflow only. Collection chat no longer advertises or routes to a `grading` supervisor capability until that path has a real wired implementation instead of a passthrough dead-end.

---

### Decision: Coin Grading Backend Contract

**Date:** 2026-07-01
**Agent:** Cassius
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED
**Issue:** #374

## Decision

Issue #374 uses a dedicated async AI job endpoint, `POST /api/coins/:id/grade`, backed by Python `POST /api/grade`.

## Contract

- Go endpoint returns `202` with the normal `services.AIJobSubmissionResponse`.
- New job type is `coin_grading`.
- Python grading response is `{ "report": string }`.
- Completed Go job result is JSON `{ "gradingReport": string }`.
- The workflow requires at least one owner-scoped coin image; image-less coins return `400 {"error":"No image available for grading"}`.
- The saved `Coin.Grade` field is not updated automatically.

## Rationale

This preserves the existing AI job polling/notification contract, avoids chat attachment coupling, and keeps grade updates explicitly user-controlled.

---

### Decision: Python Agent Dynamic Set Builder Workflow (Phase 2)

**Date:** 2026-07-26
**Agent:** Cassius
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED
**Issue:** specs/011-dynamic-set-builder-correction-plan.md (Phase 2)

## Context

Spec 011 (Dynamic Set Builder) requires a Python multi-agent group-chat/magentic workflow that turns a free-text prompt into a structured Set Proposal for human review, without ever creating a set itself.

## Decision

- Added `POST /api/set-builder/run` to the existing router in `src/agent/app/routes.py`, covered by existing `InternalServiceAuthMiddleware`.
- Added `SetBuilderRequest` (Pydantic, `extra="forbid"`) with bounded `prompt` (500 chars), `max_turns` (1-8, default 4), `max_slots` (1-300, default 200), `enable_external_lookup` (default `True`), and optional `feedback`.
- Added response DTOs: `SetBuilderResponse` (status, proposal, clarification_question, failure_reason, transcript_summary, turns_used). Status is one of `completed`, `clarification_needed`, `rejected`, `failed`, `limit_reached` — there is no "set created" outcome.
- Added LangGraph `StateGraph` with five nodes (intent_analyst, roster_researcher, collection_matcher, validator, finalize). Each LLM-calling node increments turn counter; conditional edges route to finalize once status is set or turns exhausted.
- Roster research uses `get_search_model`/`get_chat_model` from `app/llm/provider.py` per existing per-request LLM config pattern.
- Top-level `run_set_builder_workflow(request)` is what routes.py calls and what tests monkeypatch.

## Validation

- `python -m pytest tests/test_set_builder.py -v` (12 passed)
- `python -m pytest -q` — full agent suite, 182 passed
- `python -m ruff check app/models/requests.py app/models/responses.py app/routes.py app/teams/set_builder.py tests/test_set_builder.py` — clean

### Decision: Phase 3 Backend Submission Slice Complete

**Date:** 2026-07-26
**Agent:** Cassius
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED
**Issue:** specs/011-dynamic-set-builder-correction-plan.md (Phase 3)

## Context

Task was to finish and verify `POST /set-builder/runs` as a real, safe submission endpoint: queue a run only, create no set or proposal.

## Decision

- `POST /set-builder/runs` is wired under the `protected` (JWT-required) route group in `main.go`, calling `SetBuilderHandler.CreateRun` → `SetBuilderService.CreateRun`.
- Only inserts a `SetBuilderRun` row with status `queued` and owner-scoped `UserID` from JWT context. No `SetProposal`, `ProposalSlot`, `CoinSet`, or `CoinSetTarget` is touched.
- Regenerated OpenAPI because the new route/request/response shapes were undocumented and drift detection was failing.

## Validation

- `go build ./...` — clean.
- `go vet ./...` — clean.
- `go test ./...` (full suite) — all packages pass, including `TestRegisteredAPIRoutesAreDocumentedInOpenAPI`.
- `go test ./handlers -run TestSetBuilder -v`, `go test ./services -run TestSetBuilder -v`, `go test ./repository -run TestSetBuilder -v` — all pass.

## Alignment

- Principle I: handler stays thin; all persistence lives in `SetBuilderService` / `SetBuilderRepository`.
- Principle VII: Swagger annotations present; OpenAPI regenerated.
- Principle XI: owner scoping enforced via JWT auth middleware under `protected` group.

### Decision: User custom mint/location CRUD is already fully implemented

**Date:** 2026-07-27
**Agent:** Cassius
**Status:** Informational (test coverage added)

## Context

Task requested backend support for user-scoped custom mint/location CRUD, but discovered the entire feature already exists in the codebase.

## Finding

- Model: `MintLocation.UserID *uint` (nil = global, non-nil = private)
- Repository: `CreatePrivate`, `FindOwnedByID`, `ListVisibleTo`, `ExistsVisibleTo`
- Service: `CreatePrivate`, `UpdatePrivate`, `DeletePrivate`, `List`
- Handler: `CreatePrivate`, `UpdatePrivate`, `DeletePrivate`, `List` with Swagger
- Routes: Protected routes under `main.go:308–312`
- AutoMigrate: `MintLocation` included

## Added This Session

Service-layer test coverage (8 new tests):
- `TestMintLocationService_CreatePrivateSetsUserID`
- `TestMintLocationService_CreatePrivateDuplicateRejectsNameCollidingWithGlobal`
- `TestMintLocationService_CreatePrivateTwoUsersSameNameAllowed`
- `TestMintLocationService_UpdatePrivateOwnerScopingRejectsOtherUser`
- `TestMintLocationService_UpdatePrivateOwnerCanRenameOwnMint`
- `TestMintLocationService_UpdatePrivateCannotMutateGlobalMint`
- `TestMintLocationService_DeletePrivateOwnerScopingRejectsOtherUser`
- `TestMintLocationService_DeletePrivateCannotDeleteGlobalMint`
- `TestMintLocationService_ListReturnsGlobalAndUsersOwn`

## Key Design Notes

- Owner-scoping enforced at repository layer (`FindOwnedByID` uses `WHERE id = ? AND user_id = ?`).
- Private mint name cannot shadow a global entry visible to the user.
- Two users may hold private mints with the same name — separate visibility scopes.
- In-use guard applies to both global and private delete paths.

### Decision: Agentic Set Submit UX Uses Set Builder Run, Not Local Set Creation

**Date:** 2026-07-26
**Agent:** Aurelia
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

## Context

Phase 3 of Dynamic Set Builder correction plan required unblocking the Agentic option in `SetCreationWizard.vue`. Coordinator had already added `createSetBuilderRun` to API client.

## Decision

- `SetCreationWizard.vue` enables normal submit button for `setType === 'agentic'` and emits standard `submit` payload (including `agenticPrompt`) without attempting local set creation.
- `SetsPage.vue`'s `createSet` branches on `value.setType === 'agentic'`: calls `createSetBuilderRun({ prompt: value.agenticPrompt || value.name })`, closes modal, resets form, shows confirmation dialog.
- Both agentic and standard/goal/smart/CSV error paths use `useDialog().showAlert(...)` instead of `window.alert`.

## Validation

- `npm run test -- src/components/sets/__tests__/SetCreationWizard.test.ts src/pages/__tests__/SetsPage.test.ts src/pages/__tests__/SetDetailPage.test.ts` — 9/9 passed
- `npm run type-check` — clean

## Alignment

- Principle III: strict typing preserved
- Principle IV: minimal change scoped to wizard button/copy and one branch in SetsPage
- Constitution "no raw `window.alert`" convention: replaced with `useDialog`

---

### Decision: User Custom Mint Locations UI — Global/User Separation

**Date:** 2026-07-27
**Agent:** Aurelia
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

## Context

Cassius added user-scoped `/mint-locations` protected routes. `getMintLocations()` returns mixed list of global (userId=null) and user-owned (userId=number) locations. UI needed to present only user-owned entries as editable in Settings.

## Decision

`SettingsDataSection.vue` calls `getMintLocations()` and filters result to `m.userId != null` via computed property (`userMintLocations`). Global/admin locations excluded from list, badge count, and form context. Create/update/delete use user-scoped wrappers, never admin paths.

## Validation

- 10 Vitest tests including explicit test: "renders only user-scoped locations, not global"
- `npm.cmd run type-check` passes
- Commit `84e01f1` on beta branch

---

### Decision: CategoryEraConfirmModal z-index fix

**Date:** 2026-07-27
**Agent:** Aurelia
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

## Context

During Add Coin agentic mode, `CategoryEraConfirmModal` opened invisibly because `CoinSearchChat` sidebar (`z-[1400]`) covered it — modal used `z-[300]`.

## Root Cause

Modal uses `<Teleport to="body">`, placing overlay as sibling of `CoinSearchChat` root div. Since 300 < 1400, sidebar always painted on top.

## Decision

Raise `CategoryEraConfirmModal`'s overlay from `z-[300]` to `z-[1600]`.

**Z-index scale after fix:**
| Element | z-index |
|---|---|
| CoinSearchChat sidebar | 1400 |
| Note-draft modal | 1500 |
| CategoryEraConfirmModal | 1600 |

## Test Pattern

For teleported Vue components: stub `Teleport: true` in `global.stubs` so content renders inline — `wrapper.find()` and `wrapper.trigger()` work normally.

## Files Changed

- `src/web/src/components/chat/CategoryEraConfirmModal.vue` — z-[300] → z-[1600]
- `src/web/src/components/__tests__/CategoryEraConfirmModal.test.ts` — new (4 tests including z-index regression guard)

## Alignment

- Principle IV: smallest complete fix, targeted regression coverage
- §17 Quality Gate: type-check passed, targeted tests pass

---

### Decision: Mint Map List + Grid Layout

**Date:** 2026-07-27
**Agent:** Aurelia
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

## Context

Mint map page showed only Leaflet map with coins revealed via floating drawer on marker click. No summary overview of which mints were represented without mousing over each marker.

## Decision

Added `MintListPanel.vue` alongside `MintMapLeaflet.vue` in two-column CSS grid layout:

- **Desktop:** 260px scrollable list on left, map fills remaining width
- **Mobile:** Single-column stack; map first (primary), list below capped at 280px
- List items show: `displayName`, `region` (uppercase label), count badge, coin name preview (first 2, with `+N more` suffix)
- Selecting mint from list emits `select-mint` to page, updates `selectedMintId`, highlights marker, opens drawer
- Detail view: existing `MintCoinDrawer` (fixed-position, `z-[1100]`) continues as selected-mint surface

## Validation

- 9 new `MintListPanel.test.ts` unit tests
- 2 new `MintMapPage.test.ts` integration tests
- All 23 targeted tests pass; `vue-tsc --build` clean

## Alignment

- Principle IV: reused MintCoinDrawer, existing groupCoinsByMint, existing selectedMintId state
- Principle VI: design tokens throughout; dark theme; mobile-responsive
- §17 Quality Gate: targeted tests pass, type-check clean

---

### Decision: Mint Map Layout — Equal-Height Panel and Map Cards

**Date:** 2026-07-27
**Agent:** Aurelia
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

## Context

After `MintListPanel.vue` was added, stray vertical scrollbar appeared in gap between list panel and map. List panel taller than map card, causing mismatched heights on desktop.

Root cause: `.map-layout` used `align-items: start`, so each grid column sized independently. List panel (~692px) exceeded map (~640px). Scrollbar on `.mint-list` leaked into column gap.

## Decision

1. Set `height: min(70vh, 640px)` on `.map-layout`, remove `align-items: start` (default stretch). Both columns fill same row height.
2. Changed `.mint-map-leaflet` from `height: min(70vh, 640px)` to `height: 100%`. Added `@media (max-width: 768px)` override to `height: min(50vh, 380px)` (mobile grid is `height: auto`).
3. Removed `max-height: min(70vh, 640px)` from `.mint-list`. Added `min-height: 0` (critical flex-child shrink property). Grid row height bounds panel; `flex: 1; min-height: 0; overflow-y: auto` produces correctly scrollable list with no overflow artifact.
4. Mobile grid overrides to `grid-template-columns: 1fr; height: auto`. List panel `max-height: 280px` retained on mobile.

## Validation

- All 22 targeted tests pass
- Added layout structure test: verifies `.map-layout` contains both `MintListPanel` and `MintMapLeaflet`
- `vue-tsc --noEmit` clean

## Alignment

- Principle IV: minimal surgical change; 3 CSS properties across 3 files
- §17 Quality Gate: targeted tests pass, type-check clean

---

### Decision: TrayCoin Adapters Must Forward All MuseumTrayWell Caption Fields

**Date:** 2026-07-27
**Agent:** Aurelia
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

## Context

`MuseumTrayWell.displayCaption` reads three fields from `TrayCoin`: `purchaseDate`, `placeholder`, `wishlistPlaceholder`. Any adapter that converts a `Coin` into `TrayCoin` must explicitly map all three or captions fall back to `'TBD'`.

`ImperialFigureWellGrid.toTrayCoin()` was missing `purchaseDate`, causing every owned emperor-tracker well to display `TBD` even when coin had valid purchase date.

## Decision

- Any `Coin → TrayCoin` adapter must include `purchaseDate: coin.purchaseDate`
- Unowned figure/goal placeholders with no purchase date correctly show `'TBD'`
- Collection > Tray continues to pass `showCaptions: false` — unaffected

## Validation

- `npm.cmd run test -- src/components/__tests__/MuseumTrayWell.test.ts src/components/__tests__/MuseumTray.test.ts src/components/emperor-tracker/__tests__/ImperialFigureWellGrid.test.ts src/pages/__tests__/TrayViewPage.test.ts` — all 37 tests pass
- `npm.cmd run type-check` — clean

## Alignment

- Principle IV: smallest complete fix
- Principle IX: UI correctness — real dates shown where real dates exist

---

### Decision: Unknown Mint moved into the side panel as a first-class list entry

**Date:** 2026-07-27
**Agent:** Aurelia
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

## Context

`UnattributedMintBucket` lived below map row as collapsible card. Consumed vertical space below map/list pair; required separate expand interaction; second-class compared to matched-mint list.

## Decision

All unattributable coins (both `aggregation.unknown` and `aggregation.unmatched`) collapsed into single virtual `MintGroup` using sentinel `UNKNOWN_MINT_ID = 0`. This group appended to `panelGroups` and passed to `MintListPanel`.

- `MintMapLeaflet` continues to receive only `aggregation.matched` (no phantom marker)
- `selectedGroup` checks `selectedMintId === UNKNOWN_MINT_ID`, returns virtual group, opens `MintCoinDrawer`
- `UnattributedMintBucket` no longer imported or rendered
- Map-layout height increased from `min(70vh, 640px)` to `min(80vh, 800px)` since below-map section removed
- Mobile stacked layout preserved

## Validation

- `npm.cmd run test -- src/pages/__tests__/MintMapPage.test.ts src/components/map/__tests__/MintListPanel.test.ts src/utils/__tests__/mintMap.test.ts` — 29/29 pass
- `npm.cmd run type-check` — clean

## Alignment

- Principle IV: simplest complete change; reuses existing panel + drawer
- Principle VI: consistent tap-to-select interaction
- §17: targeted test coverage for all acceptance criteria

### Decision: Phase 2 Python Set-Builder QA Coverage

**Date:** 2026-07-26
**Agent:** Brutus
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED
**Issue:** specs/011-dynamic-set-builder-correction-plan.md (Phase 2)

## Context

Cassius landed the Phase 2 Python set-builder workflow while Brutus was drafting QA coverage in the same session. Test coverage was added against the landed contract.

## Confirmed Contract

1. Route: `POST /api/set-builder/run`, guarded by existing `X-Internal-Service-Token` middleware
2. Route body: `await run_set_builder_workflow(request)` — route does not build/invoke graph itself
3. Response contract:
   - `SetBuilderResponse.status` is one of `completed`, `clarification_needed`, `rejected`, `failed`, `limit_reached`
   - Only `status == "completed"` populates `proposal`; ambiguous/unbounded prompts return clarification/failed/limit with `proposal = None`
   - `SetBuilderSlot` carries `criteria`, `group`, `sort_order`, `verification_status`

## Test Additions

`src/agent/tests/test_set_builder_api.py` (24 tests, all passing):
- Request validation: empty/missing/oversized prompt, oversized feedback, bounds checks
- Response schema: slot defaults, verification status, proposal presence/absence by status
- Route: requires internal token (401), rejects invalid body (422), returns structured response, handles workflow failure as structured failure (not 500)

## Alignment

- Constitution §17/§21: targeted regression coverage without editing implementation files
- Principle IV: test-only change validated against actual landed contract

---

### Decision: Agentic Set Builder Correction — QA Checklist & Phase 3 Submit Coverage

**Date:** 2026-07-26
**Agent:** Brutus
**Status:** IN PROGRESS (tracking, not implementation-blocking)

## Context

`specs/011-dynamic-set-builder-correction-plan.md` defines Phases 0-6. Cassius/Aurelia have active uncommitted work. Brutus added only a new, independent test file.

## What Exists Today

- Models: `SetBuilderRun`, `SetProposal`, `ProposalSlot`
- Repository: full lifecycle (`CreateRun`, `StartRun`, `CompleteRun`, `FailRun`, `CreateProposalWithSlots`, `ListProposals`, `GetProposalForUser`, `MarkApproved`, `MarkRejected`, `MarkExpired`)
- Service: `CreateRun`, `FindPendingProposalByPrompt`, `CreateProposalFromWorkflow`, `ListProposals`, `GetProposal`, `RejectProposal`
- Handler: only `POST /set-builder/runs` (`CreateRun`) implemented and wired
- Not yet implemented: GET list/get routes, PUT edit, POST approve (transactional set creation), POST reject, POST regenerate handlers

## Added This Session

`src/api/handlers/set_builder_handler_test.go` — proves currently live Phase 0/Phase 3 contract at HTTP layer:
- `TestSetBuilderHandlerCreateRunRequiresAuth` — 401 without bearer token
- `TestSetBuilderHandlerCreateRunRejectsBlankPrompt` — 400, zero persisted runs
- `TestSetBuilderHandlerCreateRunPersistsQueuedRunWithoutCreatingSet` — 202, run persisted with status=queued, trimmed prompt, correct userId, **zero** `CoinSet`/`CoinSetTarget`/`SetProposal` rows
- `TestSetBuilderHandlerCreateRunIsScopedPerUser` — two users get independent runs

All new tests pass: `go test ./handlers -run TestSetBuilderHandler -v` (4/4 PASS).

### Decision: Auction Sync Auto-Creates In-App Calendar Events

**Date:** 2026-07-01
**Agent:** Cassius
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

## Context

`/auctions/sync` upserts NumisBids and CNG watchlist lots, but newly tracked active lots were not linked to in-app calendar entries despite `AuctionLot.EventID` and `AuctionEvent` already existing.

## Decision

Add repository-level `UpsertWithCalendarEvent` for sync paths only. It creates an `AuctionEvent` and links `AuctionLot.EventID` in the same transaction only when the source-aware upsert inserts a new lot with status `watching` or `bidding`. Existing lots update without new events, and `passed`/`won`/`lost` lots do not auto-create events.

## Validation

- `go test -v .\repository -run "TestAuctionLotRepository_Upsert"`
- `go test -v .\handlers -run "TestAuctionLotHandlerUpdateStatus"`
- `go test ./...`

## Alignment

- Principle I: GORM and multi-step create/link live in repository transaction.
- Principle IV: Small, source-aware extension of existing upsert/sync workflow.
- §17: Targeted regression coverage plus full Go API tests pass.

---

### Decision: Cassius Scraper Transport Helper

**Date:** 2026-07-01
**Agent:** Cassius
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

## Context

Issue #373 starts with auditing shared scraper behavior across NumisBids and CNG. Both providers need authenticated HTTP session mechanics, but their login payloads, auth verification rules, URL safety, pagination, parsing, and provider-specific sentinel errors must remain provider-owned.

## Decision

Added a package-private shared helper in `src/api/services/scraper_transport.go` for cookie-jar client creation, request/header construction, form POST construction, request execution, status checks, response body read/close behavior, and request error wrapping. The first segment intentionally does not refactor `NumisBidsService` or `CNGAuctionService` to use it yet.

## Validation

- `go test -v ./services -run "Test(NewScraper|DoScraper|ReadScraper|CNGAuctionService|CanonicalCNG|ParseWatchlist|WatchlistDiagnostics|FetchWatchlist|Login|VerifyAuthentication)"`

## Alignment

- Principle I: helper stays in service layer and remains HTTP-provider agnostic.
- Principle IV: simple, focused extraction without broad provider refactor.
- §21: new helper methods have focused regression coverage.

### Decision: User-Initiated Camera Start

**Date:** 2026-06-30
**Agent:** Aurelia
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

## Context

iOS/PWA users should not see a camera permission prompt just by opening Add Coin agentic mode or Identify Coin. The app still needs to preserve the guided live camera experience once the user intentionally starts capture.

## Decision

`src/web/src/pages/AddCoinPage.vue` and `src/web/src/pages/CoinLookupPage.vue` no longer start camera streams from page mount, agentic mode entry, or Identify Coin retake. Both pages show a clear "Start Camera" placeholder action that calls `startCamera()` only from a user tap. Existing upload-library actions remain available, shutter buttons stay disabled until `cameraReady`, and Add Coin continues stopping active streams when leaving agentic mode.

## Validation

- `npm.cmd run test -- src/pages/__tests__/CoinLookupPage.test.ts src/__tests__/ui-patterns.test.ts`
- `npm.cmd run type-check`

## Alignment

- Principle III: Vue strict type-check passed.
- Principle IV: Simple complete change across both affected camera entry points.
- Principle VI: Preserves existing dark, token-based camera UI and upload fallback.

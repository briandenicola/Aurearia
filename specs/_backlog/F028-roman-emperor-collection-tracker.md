# F028 — Track collection progress toward every Roman Emperor (West + East, to 476 AD)

## Summary

The app was originally built around tracking ancient Roman coins, but there is
no way today to see collection progress against a *historical* completion
goal — only against user-defined sets. This feature adds an opt-in tracker,
under Stats, that shows how a user is trending toward owning at least one
coin of every Western Roman Emperor (27 BC – 476 AD) and every Eastern Roman
Emperor up to the same 476 AD cutoff (Byzantine emperors after that point are
explicitly out of scope for now — a natural follow-on, not part of this
card). Progress is grouped by dynasty/era, and displayed using the app's
existing "Tray" museum-cabinet visual (`MuseumTray.vue`/`MuseumTrayWell.vue`,
already used at `/tray`) — owned emperors show the user's actual coin, unowned
emperors render as an empty well using the tray's existing placeholder state.
The feature is disabled by default and enabled per-user in Settings, matching
the existing `coinOfDayEnabled`-style opt-in pattern.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] A per-user setting (`User.EmperorTrackerEnabled`, default off) can be
      turned on/off from Settings → Account, next to the existing
      `coinOfDayEnabled` toggle.
- [ ] When enabled, a new Stats sub-page (e.g. `/stats/emperors`) becomes
      available, showing overall completion (X of Y emperors owned, as both
      a count and a percentage) plus a per-dynasty/per-era completion
      breakdown (e.g. "Julio-Claudian — 3 of 5 (60%)", "Severan — 1 of 8
      (13%)") — this is a first-class stats display, not just an implied
      byproduct of the tray view: the completion numbers must be visible
      even before scrolling to a given dynasty's wells.
- [ ] The default (and primary) goal is the **commonly accepted Augustuses**
      only — i.e. every `role: emperor` figure, exactly as already scoped
      above. Usurpers were, by definition, never accepted as legitimate
      emperors, so they (and empresses, and Caesar/other figures) are
      excluded from this goal by default — this keeps the core "collect all
      the emperors" goal realistic and unambiguous for every user out of
      the box.
- [ ] Users can optionally expand what they track via three independent
      Settings toggles (default off): **show usurpers**, **show empresses**,
      **show other figures** (Caesars who never acceded + Julius Caesar).
      Enabling one adds its own separate, independently-tracked section to
      `/stats/emperors` (own completion count/percentage, own dynasty/era
      grouping, own tray rendering) — it does **not** get merged into the
      core emperor completion number. This lets a user who wants a bigger
      or more textured challenge opt into tracking more, without changing
      what "100%" means for anyone who leaves the defaults alone.
- [ ] Each dynasty/era section renders its emperors using the existing tray
      visual (`MuseumTray`/`MuseumTrayWell`) — an owned emperor's well shows
      the user's real coin (image, click-through to coin detail, exactly like
      `/tray` today); an **unowned emperor's well is a visible placeholder**
      (the tray's existing "no image" state), labeled with the emperor's
      name, so a user can see at a glance exactly which emperors they're
      missing, not just a number.
- [ ] The page surfaces a "what to pursue next" list of missing emperors to
      help the user prioritize acquisitions — see the Suggestions section
      below for scope/phasing.
- [ ] Matching a coin to an emperor is structured, not fuzzy-text: when a
      coin's Category is Roman, the coin form offers an **optional**
      type-ahead picker over a curated list of Roman imperial figures
      (emperors, empresses, heirs/Caesars, usurpers), each tagged with a
      `role`. Only figures tagged `role: emperor` count toward this
      feature's completion stat — picking "Livia" (Augustus's wife, never
      an emperor herself) must never be counted as an Augustus coin. The
      picker never forces a choice: leaving it blank is always valid, and
      the existing free-text `Ruler` field is unaffected/unchanged.
- [ ] The imperial-figure picker supports filtering the list by `role`
      (Emperor / Empress / Caesar / Usurper / Other) — the curated dataset
      runs to 153 entries (see Notes), so browsing or searching it without
      a way to narrow by role is impractical.
- [ ] Western and Eastern Roman emperors are both covered, capped at 476 AD
      by *reign start* (an emperor already reigning by 476 is included in
      full even if their reign continued past it, e.g. Zeno; no emperor
      whose reign began after 476, e.g. Anastasius I, is included in v1).
- [ ] Disabling the setting hides the Stats sub-page entirely; no background
      job or scheduled work runs for users who haven't opted in.

## Proposed approach

### Data: new static reference dataset, not the existing Coin Set / Target system

`models.CoinSetTarget` (used by "defined"/"goal" Coin Sets, see
`repository/set_repository.go`) looks like a natural fit at first glance — it
already models a named target with a completion percentage
(`GetSetCompletion`) — but doesn't actually fit:

1. `GetSetCompletion` only matches coins that are **manually added as members
   of that specific set** (`GetCoinsInSet`), not the user's whole collection.
   Requiring a user to manually add every Roman coin they own to a special
   "Emperors" set before this works at all defeats the point of an automatic
   tracker.
2. `CoinSetTarget.MatchRules` (a generic `*JSONObject`) exists in the model
   but is **not read anywhere** — `matchCoinToTarget` only matches on
   Year/MintMark/Denomination/Country(-via-Ruler-substring)/Material, tuned
   for modern (US mint-mark style) coin sets, not ruler identity.

Recommendation: a new, purpose-built static reference table (seeded, not
user-editable) — `models.RomanImperialFigure{ID, Name, Aliases []string-ish,
Role (emperor|empress|caesar|usurper|other), Region (west|east), Dynasty,
ReignStart, ReignEnd, SortOrder, RarityTier}` — scoped to *imperial figures*
broadly, not just emperors, since real coins commonly depict empresses,
heirs/Caesars, and usurpers who were never emperor themselves (see Matching
strategy below for why this matters). Per-user progress is computed on
request against the user's full active (non-wishlist, non-sold — confirm in
Open Questions) collection, the same way `AuctionLotService.Recommend`/
`MarketSignal` compute their results live rather than maintaining a
stored/cached table. Collections are small enough (hundreds, not millions of
coins) that this doesn't need a background job.

### Matching strategy: structured selection, not fuzzy text

`Coin.Ruler` is free text today (`binding:"max=200"`, no enum, no existing
canonical list anywhere in the codebase), and real collections have
"Augustus", "Octavian", "Divus Augustus", spelling variants, etc. — a naive
exact- or fuzzy-match against that field would under-count badly and is the
wrong foundation to build on.

Instead: add a new, optional `Coin.RomanImperialFigureID *uint` (nullable
FK into `RomanImperialFigure`), surfaced in the coin form as a type-ahead
picker **gated on `Category == Roman`**. This directly solves the fuzzy
alias-matching risk by replacing it with an explicit, unambiguous selection
made once at coin-entry time — no normalization/substring-matching code
needed at all for coins entered this way. Critically, the picker's list is
not limited to the ~90 emperors: it includes every commonly-depicted
imperial figure (empresses, heirs/Caesars, usurpers), each carrying a
`role`. Selecting a non-emperor figure (e.g. Livia, Faustina, a Caesar who
never acceded) is completely valid and simply doesn't count toward the
emperor-completion stat — the field is honestly "who's depicted on this
coin," not artificially forced into "which emperor does this map to." The
lookup/search endpoint behind the picker accepts an optional `role` filter
so the frontend can offer role tabs/chips (Emperor / Empress / Caesar /
Usurper / Other) instead of forcing users to search the full 153-entry
list by name alone.

The picker is optional and additive: it never replaces or requires the
free-text `Ruler` field, and a coin can be left unmatched. Given the app's
current user base has at most a few hundred coins entered, not thousands,
there is **no bulk fuzzy-matching migration for existing coins** in scope —
existing coins simply show as unmatched until a user opens them and picks
the figure themselves (a one-time, per-coin, user-driven action, not a
background job or automated best-effort guess). This meaningfully shrinks
the feature's original biggest risk: there's no fuzzy-matcher to get wrong,
tune, or need an override affordance for.

### Suggestions: which missing emperor(s) to pursue next

Phase this the same way F023 (bid recommendation) was phased into a
historical-data-only V1 and a market-data-assisted V2 — don't build the
expensive version before the cheap one proves useful.

**V1 — static, no agent/network call.** The curated `RomanImperialFigure`
dataset (see Data section) already carries a `RarityTier` field
(`common | scarce | rare | very_rare`, hand-curated alongside the
name/dynasty/alias/role data — e.g. an Augustus or Constantine I denarius is
routinely available and inexpensive; a Romulus Augustulus or a legitimate
Otho coin is a genuine numismatic rarity most collectors never own). The
suggestions list is simply the user's missing emperors sorted with the most
*attainable* ones first (common/scarce before rare/very_rare), optionally
tie-broken by dynasty proximity to eras the user already collects in. This
requires no new backend service, no agent call, and no live pricing — it's a
sort over already-loaded data, computable entirely in
`AuctionLotService`-adjacent Go code or even client-side.

**V2 — market-data assisted (stretch, mirrors F023's `bid_market_signal.py`
pattern).** Once V1 ships and the rarity-tier heuristic has been used for a
while, consider reusing the same Python-agent market-search approach F023 V2
built: for a specific missing emperor the user picks, search live auction
results for coins of that ruler and surface a rough price range / recent
availability, the same way `bid_market_signal.py` does today for a specific
tracked lot. This is meaningfully more effort (new agent request shape keyed
by emperor name/dynasty instead of a tracked lot, a new Go proxy method, new
UI) and depends on the Ruler-matching problem already being solved well
enough that "search for coins of Emperor X" produces relevant results — do
not start V2 before V1's rarity-tier sort has been validated against real
usage.

Do not build a live web-search-backed suggestion engine as the *first*
version of this feature — that repeats the exact overreach F023 V1
deliberately avoided (a recommendation that's only as good as data/matching
no one has stress-tested yet).

### Dynasty/era scope

The actual curated dataset is `specs/_backlog/F028-imperial-figures.md` — a
first pass exists (reviewed 2026-07-20) covering:

**Western Roman (27 BC – 476 AD)**, roughly: Julio-Claudian → Flavian →
Nerva–Antonine → Severan → Crisis of the Third Century (Maximinus Thrax
through Carinus/Numerian) → Tetrarchic/Diocletianic → Constantinian →
Valentinianic → Theodosian (West) → the fragmented last Western emperors
(Petronius Maximus through Romulus Augustulus, 455–476).

**Eastern Roman**: Theodosian (East: Arcadius, Theodosius II, Marcian) →
Leonid (Leo I, Leo II, Zeno, the usurper Basiliscus). The 476 cutoff rule
was resolved during curation: an emperor is in scope if their reign **began**
on or before 476 AD, even if it continued after. **Zeno is explicitly
included** in full (474–491) on that basis, since his first reign began in
474 — his restored reign is not truncated. Anastasius I (r. 491–518) is
excluded since his reign began after the cutoff.

87 entries carry `role: emperor` (the ones that drive the completion
stat); the full dataset with usurpers, Caesars, empresses, and Julius Caesar
(included as a non-emperor `role: other` precursor entry, per explicit
request) runs to 153 rows. See the curated file for the complete list,
per-entry rationale, and remaining open follow-ups (rarity tiers are an
unsourced first guess).

### UI

- Coin form: a new optional type-ahead field, "Imperial figure," shown only
  when Category is Roman, sitting alongside the existing free-text `Ruler`
  input (not replacing it). Backed by the curated `RomanImperialFigure`
  list; supports leaving it unset. Includes a `role` filter (tabs or chips —
  Emperor / Empress / Caesar / Usurper / Other) so the 153-entry list is
  actually browsable, not just searchable by typing a name. The backing
  lookup/search endpoint (see Matching strategy) accepts a `role` query
  param so this is a server-side filter, not a client-side scan of the
  full list.
- Settings toggle: `SettingsAccountSection.vue`, same visual pattern as the
  existing `coinOfDayEnabled` checkbox — plus three more checkboxes, shown
  only once the main toggle is on: "Also track usurpers," "Also track
  empresses," "Also track other figures (Caesars & precursors)," each
  independently off by default.
- New page under Stats (existing sibling pages: `/stats/mint-map`,
  `/stats/timeline`, `/stats/health`, `/stats/value-trends`,
  `/stats/investment-breakdown`, `/stats/distribution` — add
  `/stats/emperors` alongside them), gated on
  `auth.user.emperorTrackerEnabled`. The page always shows the primary
  Emperor section first; any of the three optional categories the user has
  enabled render as additional sections below it, each with its own
  dynasty/era grouping and its own completion count/percentage — never
  merged into the primary emperor stat.
- Reuses `MuseumTray.vue`/`MuseumTrayWell.vue` as-is where possible: an
  unmatched emperor is just a `TrayCoin`-shaped entry with no `images`, which
  already renders `MuseumTrayWell`'s built-in placeholder (a dim coin icon)
  with no code changes needed there. Needs a synthetic, non-colliding `id`
  scheme for placeholder wells (e.g. negative IDs) and `interactive: false`
  (or a different click behavior — see Open Questions) so clicking an empty
  well doesn't try to navigate to a nonexistent coin detail page.

## Constitution alignment

- Principle I (Clear Layered Architecture) — new repository/service/handler
  trio for the emperor reference data + per-user progress computation;
  reuses existing tray components at the presentation layer rather than
  forking them.
- Principle III (Strict Types and Explicit Contracts) — the
  `RomanImperialFigure` dataset and match-result shape need explicit Go
  structs / TS types, not ad hoc maps.
- Principle IV (Simple Complete Changes) — do not extend
  `CoinSetTarget`/`matchCoinToTarget` for this; that system's assumptions
  (set-scoped membership, US-coin-oriented match fields) don't fit and
  bending it would make both features harder to reason about.
- Principle VI (Consistent User Experience) — reuses the existing tray visual
  language exactly rather than inventing a new "collection progress" UI
  pattern.

## Open questions

- [x] Who curates the canonical `RomanImperialFigure` dataset, and where
      does it live? A first pass (153 figures, 87 of them `role: emperor`)
      has been curated at `specs/_backlog/F028-imperial-figures.md` and
      implemented as seed data (`models.RomanImperialFigure`,
      `database/roman_imperial_figure_seed.go`, following the existing
      `seedMintLocations` idempotent-seed pattern).
- [x] Do sold coins count toward "collected"? **Resolved**: currently-owned,
      non-wishlist, non-sold coins only — matches how the rest of the app
      already treats "collection" vs "sold" vs "wishlist."
- [ ] Should an empty (unmatched) emperor well be non-interactive, or should
      clicking it deep-link to "Add Coin" with that emperor pre-selected in
      the new "Imperial figure" picker? Nice-to-have, not required for v1.
- [x] Exact 476 AD cutoff handling for Eastern emperors whose reigns straddle
      that date (notably Zeno) — **resolved**: in scope if the reign began
      on or before 476, even if it continued after. Zeno is included in
      full (474–491); Anastasius I (began 491) is not.
- [x] Should co-emperors (e.g. Lucius Verus, Geta) count as separate tracked
      entries? **Resolved**: yes, separate entries — matches the curated
      dataset's first pass (87 `role: emperor` entries) as-is, no rework
      needed.
- [ ] Who curates the per-emperor `rarityTier` used to sort V1 suggestions,
      and against what standard (auction frequency? price? both?) — same
      content-ownership question as the core dataset, called out separately
      here since it's easy to under-scope as "just add a column."
- [ ] Is a V2 (agent-assisted, live market search) suggestion engine even
      wanted, or is the V1 static rarity sort sufficient long-term? Don't
      pre-approve V2 scope now — revisit after V1 ships and is used.
- [ ] Should the three optional categories (usurpers, empresses, other) each
      also get their own V1 "what to pursue next" suggestions list once
      enabled, or is that list a core-emperor-only feature for v1? Leaning
      toward core-emperor-only for v1 to keep scope bounded, with the
      optional categories being pure display/tracking (no suggestions) until
      there's a reason to add it.

## Notes

Prior art investigated during planning:
- `/tray` (`TrayViewPage.vue`, `components/tray/MuseumTray.vue`,
  `MuseumTrayWell.vue`, `utils/trayLayout.ts`) — the existing museum-cabinet
  display this feature is asked to reuse. Confirmed `MuseumTrayWell.vue`
  already has a graceful no-image placeholder state, which is exactly what
  an "emperor not yet collected" well needs with no component changes.
- `models.CoinSetTarget` / `CoinSetCompletion` / `matchCoinToTarget`
  (`repository/set_repository.go:436-702`) — the existing "defined set"
  completion-tracking system. Investigated as a possible reuse target;
  documented above why it doesn't fit as-is (set-scoped membership, unused
  `MatchRules` field, US-coin-oriented matching).
- `User.CoinOfDayEnabled` (`models/user.go`) and its toggle in
  `SettingsAccountSection.vue` — the exact per-user opt-in pattern to mirror
  for `EmperorTrackerEnabled`.
- `AuctionLotService.Recommend`/`MarketSignal` (F023) — precedent for
  computing a derived result live per-request rather than maintaining a
  stored/cached table, applicable here since per-user emperor-match
  computation is cheap at realistic collection sizes.

Tracking issue: [#501](https://github.com/briandenicola/Aurearia/issues/501)
(request + research; implementation not yet started).

Curated dataset: `specs/_backlog/F028-imperial-figures.md` (first pass,
153 imperial figures, 87 `role: emperor`).

## History

- 2026-07-20: created (status: backlog) — feature request to track
  Western + Eastern Roman Emperor collection completeness (to 476 AD),
  grouped by dynasty/era, displayed via the existing tray UI, opt-in per
  user. Byzantine (post-476) emperors explicitly deferred to a future card.
- 2026-07-20: refined — made completion stats (overall + per-dynasty
  percentage) an explicit, first-class acceptance criterion rather than an
  implied byproduct of the tray view, and added a "what to pursue next"
  suggestions requirement, phased V1 (static rarity-tier sort, no agent
  call) / V2 (agent-assisted live market search, mirroring F023's
  `bid_market_signal.py` pattern — explicitly not to be started before V1
  ships and is validated).
- 2026-07-20: refined — replaced the free-text-fuzzy-match matching
  strategy with a structured, optional coin-form picker over a widened
  `RomanImperialFigure` dataset (emperors, empresses, heirs/Caesars,
  usurpers, each tagged with a `role`), so non-emperor figures like Livia
  are never miscounted toward an emperor's completion and no
  alias/substring-matching code is needed. No bulk migration of existing
  coins is in scope — the app's user base is small enough that users will
  pick the figure themselves when they next edit a coin.
- 2026-07-20: linked GitHub tracking issue #501.
- 2026-07-20: committed the first curated `RomanImperialFigure` dataset pass
  (`F028-imperial-figures.md`, 153 figures, 87 `role: emperor`). Resolved
  the 476-cutoff open question (in scope if reign began on or before 476 —
  Zeno included in full through 491; Anastasius I excluded) and added
  Julius Caesar as a non-emperor `role: other` precursor entry, both per
  explicit request. Added a new requirement: the imperial-figure picker
  (and its backing search endpoint) must support filtering by `role`, since
  the curated list is too large to browse by name search alone.
- 2026-07-20: refined — confirmed the default/primary goal is explicitly
  the "commonly accepted Augustuses" (`role: emperor` only; usurpers were
  by definition never accepted as legitimate emperors). Added three
  independent, default-off Settings toggles (show usurpers / show
  empresses / show other figures) that each add their own separately
  tracked section to `/stats/emperors` when enabled, so users can opt into
  a bigger or more textured goal without changing what "100%" means for
  everyone else.
- 2026-07-20: closed the two remaining implementation-blocking open
  questions ahead of starting work: sold coins do **not** count toward
  completion (currently-owned, non-wishlist only), and co-emperors **do**
  count as separate tracked entries (dataset needs no rework). Status
  remains `backlog`; implementation starting on tasks #30+.
- 2026-07-20: task #30 done — implemented `models.RomanImperialFigure`,
  `database/roman_imperial_figure_seed.go` (idempotent seed, mirroring
  `seedMintLocations`), and tests. Corrected the dataset's totals from
  earlier rough estimates to the exact seeded counts: 153 figures total,
  87 `role: emperor`. Work is on branch `feature/f028-emperor-tracker-v1`,
  not yet merged (holding for the full V1 slice per instruction).
